# Personal Performance Tracker

I built this app to enable me to keep track of all the football matches I play in terms of results and my performance. Here's how it works:

* Clicking 'Add Football Match Data' brings up a modal containing a form with controlled inputs

* The user then answers a series of questions relating to the match and then submits the form

* This data is translated into a line item which is displayed in a table

* At the same time, the statistics in the stats panel are calculated and updated to reflect the contents of the table

* The user can also filter out a team to view the table and stats for this particular team 

* Line items can also be deleted (not without confirmation) and the stats will be updated accordingly
